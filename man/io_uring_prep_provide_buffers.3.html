<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B><A HREF="io_uring_prep_provide_buffers.3.html">io_uring_prep_provide_buffers(3)</A></B> function prepares a request for
       providing the kernel with buffers. The submission queue entry <I>sqe</I> is
       setup to consume <I>nr</I> number of <I>len</I> sized buffers starting at <I>addr</I> and
       identified by the buffer group ID of <I>bgid</I> and numbered sequentially
       starting at <I>bid</I>.

       This function sets up a request to provide buffers to the io_uring
       context that can be used by read or receive operations. This is done by
       filling in the SQE <I>buf</I><B>_</B><I>group</I> field and setting <B>IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT</B> in the
       SQE <I>flags</I> member. If buffer selection is used for a request, no buffer
       should be provided in the address field. Instead, the group ID is set to
       match one that was previously provided to the kernel. The kernel will
       then select a buffer from this group for the IO operation. On successful
       completion of the IO request, the CQE <I>flags</I> field will have
       <B>IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER</B> set and the selected buffer ID will be indicated by
       the upper 16-bits of the <I>flags</I> field.

       Different buffer group IDs can be used by the application to have
       different sizes or types of buffers available. Once a buffer has been
       consumed for an operation, it is no longer known to io_uring. It must be
       re-provided if so desired or freed by the application if no longer
       needed.

       The buffer IDs are internally tracked from <I>bid</I> and sequentially ascending
       from that value. If <B>16</B> buffers are provided and start with an initial <I>bid</I>
       of 0, then the buffer IDs will range from <B>0..15</B>.  The application must be
       aware of this to make sense of the buffer ID passed back in the CQE.

       Buffer IDs always range from <B>0</B> to <B>65535</B> <B>,</B> as there are only 16-bits
       available in the CQE to pass them back. This range is independent of how
       the buffer group initially got created. Attempting to add buffer IDs
       larger than that, or buffer IDs that will wrap when cast to a 16-bit
       value, will cause the request to fail with <B>-E2BIG</B> or <B>-EINVAL</B> <B>.</B>

       Not all requests support buffer selection, as it only really makes sense
       for requests that receive data from the kernel rather than write or
       provide data.  Currently, this mode of operation is supported for any
       file read or socket receive request. Attempting to use
       <B>IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT</B> with a command that doesn't support it will result in
       a CQE <I>res</I> error of <B>-EINVAL</B>.  Buffer selection will work with operations
       that take a <B>struct</B> <B>iovec</B> as its data destination, but only if 1 iovec is

       <B>-E2BIG</B> The number of buffers provided was too big, or the <I>bid</I> was too
              big. A max value of <B>USHRT_MAX</B> buffers can be specified.

       <B>-EFAULT</B>
              Some of the user memory given was invalid for the application.

       <B>-EOVERFLOW</B>
              The product of <I>len</I> and <I>nr</I> exceed the valid amount or overflowed,
              or the sum of <I>addr</I> and the length of buffers overflowed.

       <B>-EBUSY</B> Attempt to update a slot that is already used.
