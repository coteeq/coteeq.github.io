<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B><A HREF="io_uring_prep_files_update.3.html">io_uring_prep_files_update(3)</A></B> function prepares a request for
       updating a number of previously registered file descriptors. The
       submission queue entry <I>sqe</I> is setup to use the file descriptor array
       pointed to by <I>fds</I> and of <I>nr</I><B>_</B><I>fds</I> in length to update that amount of
       previously registered files starting at offset <I>offset</I>.

       Once a previously registered file is updated with a new one, the existing
       entry is updated and then removed from the table. This operation is
       equivalent to first unregistering that entry and then inserting a new
       one, just bundled into one combined operation.

       If <I>offset</I> is specified as IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC, io_uring will allocate
       free direct descriptors instead of having the application to pass, and
       store allocated direct descriptors into <I>fds</I> array, <I>cqe-&gt;res</I> will return
       the number of direct descriptors allocated.

<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       None


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       These are the errors that are reported in the CQE <I>res</I> field. On success,
       <I>res</I> will contain the number of successfully updated file descriptors. On
       error, the following errors can occur.

       <B>-ENOMEM</B>
              The kernel was unable to allocate memory for the request.

       <B>-EINVAL</B>
              One of the fields set in the SQE was invalid.

       <B>-EFAULT</B>
              The kernel was unable to copy in the memory pointed to by <I>fds</I>.

       <B>-EBADF</B> On of the descriptors located in <I>fds</I> didn't refer to a valid file
              descriptor, or one of the file descriptors in the array referred
              to an io_uring instance.

       <B>-EOVERFLOW</B>
              The product of <I>offset</I> and <I>nr</I><B>_</B><I>fds</I> exceed the valid amount or
              overflowed.
