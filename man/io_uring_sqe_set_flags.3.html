<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B><A HREF="io_uring_sqe_set_flags.3.html">io_uring_sqe_set_flags(3)</A></B> function allows the caller to change the
       behavior of the submission queue entry by specifying flags. It enables
       the <I>flags</I> belonging to the <I>sqe</I> submission queue entry param.

       <I>flags</I> is a bit mask of 0 or more of the following values ORed together:

       <B>IOSQE_FIXED_FILE</B>
              The file descriptor in the SQE refers to the index of a previously
              registered file or direct file descriptor, not a normal file
              descriptor.

       <B>IOSQE_ASYNC</B>
              Normal operation for io_uring is to try and issue an sqe as non-
              blocking first, and if that fails, execute it in an async manner.
              To support more efficient overlapped operation of requests that
              the application knows/assumes will always (or most of the time)
              block, the application can ask for an sqe to be issued async from
              the start. Note that this flag immediately causes the SQE to be
              offloaded to an async helper thread with no initial non-blocking
              attempt.  This may be less efficient and should not be used
              liberally or without understanding the performance and efficiency
              tradeoffs.

       <B>IOSQE_IO_LINK</B>
              When this flag is specified, the SQE forms a link with the next
              SQE in the submission ring. That next SQE will not be started
              before the previous request completes. This, in effect, forms a
              chain of SQEs, which can be arbitrarily long. The tail of the
              chain is denoted by the first SQE that does not have this flag
              set. Chains are not supported across submission boundaries. Even
              if the last SQE in a submission has this flag set, it will still
              terminate the current chain. This flag has no effect on previous
              SQE submissions, nor does it impact SQEs that are outside of the
              chain tail. This means that multiple chains can be executing in
              parallel, or chains and individual SQEs. Only members inside the
              chain are serialized. A chain of SQEs will be broken if any
              request in that chain ends in error.

       <B>IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK</B>
              Like <B>IOSQE_IO_LINK</B> <B>,</B> except the links aren't severed if an error
              or unexpected result occurs.

       <B>IOSQE_IO_DRAIN</B>
              When this flag is specified, the SQE will not be started before
              previously submitted SQEs have completed, and new SQEs will not be
              must also set the <I>buf</I><B>_</B><I>group</I> field in the SQE, indicating which
              previously registered buffer group to select a buffer from.
