<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The <B><A HREF="io_uring_prep_writev.3.html">io_uring_prep_writev(3)</A></B> prepares a vectored IO write request. The
       submission queue entry <I>sqe</I> is setup to use the file descriptor <I>fd</I> to
       start writing <I>nr</I><B>_</B><I>vecs</I> from the <I>iovecs</I> array at the specified <I>offset</I>.

       On files that support seeking, if the offset is set to <B>-1</B>, the write
       operation commences at the file offset, and the file offset is
       incremented by the number of bytes written. See <B><A HREF="write.2.html">write(2)</A></B> for more
       details. Note that for an async API, reading and updating the current
       file offset may result in unpredictable behavior, unless access to the
       file is serialized. It is not encouraged to use this feature if it's
       possible to provide the desired IO offset from the application or
       library.

       On files that are not capable of seeking, the offset must be 0 or -1.

       After the write has been prepared it can be submitted with one of the
       submit functions.



</PRE>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2><PRE>
       None


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       The CQE <I>res</I> field will contain the result of the operation. See the
       related man page for details on possible values. Note that where
       synchronous system calls will return <B>-1</B> on failure and set <I>errno</I> to the
       actual error value, io_uring never uses <I>errno</I>.  Instead it returns the
       negated <I>errno</I> directly in the CQE <I>res</I> field.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       Unless an application explicitly needs to pass in more than one iovec, it
       is more efficient to use <B><A HREF="io_uring_prep_write.3.html">io_uring_prep_write(3)</A></B> rather than this
       function, as no state has to be maintained for a non-vectored IO request.
       As with any request that passes in data in a struct, that data must
       remain valid until the request has been successfully submitted. It need
       not remain valid until completion. Once a request has been submitted, the
       in-kernel state is stable. Very early kernels (5.4 and earlier) required
       state to be stable until the completion occurred. Applications can test
       for this behavior by inspecting the <B>IORING_FEAT_SUBMIT_STABLE</B> flag passed
       back from <B><A HREF="io_uring_queue_init_params.3.html">io_uring_queue_init_params(3)</A></B>.
